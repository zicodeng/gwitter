### II. What Our App Does

Our app will serve to be a tool for people wanting to visualize or analyze tweets or keywords from the social media site 'Twitter' on a map of the Earth. Users can search a particular keyword or hashtag and visually see where it was used and in what context. The tweets will be grabbed from Twitter and visually displayed onto a map using Google Maps. The app will be responsive to the word, phrase or hashtag you type, and will be able to group them depending on how much or how little you zoom in. 

For example, if a user searches for the query "#info", our app will show a heat map visually plotted onto a map of places where that hashtag was used. When the user dives deeper, they can see more detail from within the area of the map they are on, and even goto an individual tweet and be able to see the username of the person who wrote the tweet, their profile picture, the tweet itself, a timestamp, and the location of the tweet. 

### III. Who Will Use Our App

Through our app, we aim to reach a diverse set of people and professions, which include:
  - Students
  - Professors & Teachers
  - Researchers
  - Data Analysts
  - Anyone with a curiosity to explore what the world is talking about and from where. 

### IV. Main Features

1. Search for a tweet, keyword, hashtag or phrase.
2. Visualize the tweet or keyword on a heat map based on usage.
3. View statistics for each individual element of tweet.
4. Dynamically condense/group and ungroup data as you zoom in or out of the map.
